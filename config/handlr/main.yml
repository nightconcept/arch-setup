    # Default application information is stored in `~/.config/mimeapps.list`.
    #
    # In order to define a default application you need to associate a file
    # extension or mime type to a desktop entry. 
    #
    # `handlr` is an abstraction tool that helps you manage the `mimeapps.list`.
    #
    # For example:
    #
    #   - `handlr set '.png' nsxiv.desktop`
    #   - `handlr set 'image/png' nsxiv.desktop`
    #   - `handlr set 'image/*' nsxiv.desktop`
    #
    # `handlr` has autocomplete for both, file extensions (and mime types) and
    # available desktop entries on your system.
    #
    # See `https://github.com/chmln/handlr#usage` or use `handlr --help` for 
    # usage instructions. 
    #
    # Yazi is configured to use `handlr` to open files.
    #
    # IMPORTANT!
    #   Unlike other configuration files, this one is going to change more
    #   frequently, so you will need to push changes to the repo.
